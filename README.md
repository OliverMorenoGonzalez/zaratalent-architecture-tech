![Possible Architecture Solution Zaratalent](resources/Schema.png)

Why Do I publish this?
Document my research and results, implement if possible the solution in time.
Maybe find a team or set an environment for people to find a team.

You can raise an issue or search in existing issue if there is one to find a team.
Example title: "Coordinate Team (Name)"

I have the very basics of SQL, Anaconda/Jupyter and Grafana.

Enjoy!
